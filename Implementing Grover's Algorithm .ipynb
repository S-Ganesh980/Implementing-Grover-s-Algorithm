    "# Implementing Grover's Algorithm \n",
    "Here we implement Grover's algorithm in `Qiskit` by creating a quantum circuit that has the marked elements 000001 and 101010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's Algorithm has 3 main components: \n",
    "1. First, we begin by creating a superposition of all $2^n$ computational basis states by applying a Hadamard ($H$) gate on each qubit starting off in the state $\\vert0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. Here, the exponent $\\otimes n$ means that we have a tensor product of the states of $n$ qubits. \n",
    "2. Second, we apply an Oracle operator to mark the appropriate elements among the $2^n$ elements. The oracle operator applies a coefficient of $-1$ to each of the marked elements.\n",
    "3. Third, we apply a Diffusion operator, or diffuser, which inverts the amplitude of all elements about the average amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these components together, and applying the Oracle and Diffusion operators $O(\\sqrt{N = 2^n})$ times, Grover's algorithm allows us to successfully determine the elements that were marked by the Oracle operator with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase Oracle \n",
    " We will create a function below called `phase_oracle` which takes in two arguments. The first argument, $n$, gives the number of qubits in the quantum circuit. The second argument, `indices_to_mark`, is a list of the indices whose elements will be marked by the phase oracle with a phase of $-1$. Using these inputs, we then create a $2^n\\times2^n$ identity matrix, and apply a phase of $-1$ to the diagonal elements at locations given in `indices_to_mark`. We then apply the unitary operator to the quantum circuit."
